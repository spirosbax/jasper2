<!-- Spiros is a curious, diligent and driven person, suffering from entrepreneurship tendencies, who wants to apply Computational Science to the very small nano scale as well as the very big planetary scale. He is fascinated by the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, Biomedicine and Engineering. Spiros' goal is to disrupt industries using sophisticated, intelligent information processing systems. He believes that the aftermath of the ethical Artificial Intelligence revolution will improve the global living standard and result in a more egalitarian society.  -->

I am currently completing my military obligations in the Greek Army as required by the Hellenic Constitution. Previously I completed my undergraduate studies in the [Department of Informatics at the Ionian University](http://di.ionio.gr/) during which I graduated **1st in my class** and recieved the **Ionian University Academic Excelence Award**. There, I founded the Ionian University IEEE Student Branch and was the Chairman for **2 years**. I was fortunate to work closely with [Prof. Ioannis Karydis](https://di.ionio.gr/en/department/staff/331-karydis/), [Prof. Katia-Lida Kermanidis](https://di.ionio.gr/en/department/staff/92-kermanidis/) and [Prof. Markos Avlonitis](https://di.ionio.gr/en/department/staff/89-avlonitis/) as an Undergraduate Research Assistant in 3 research projects. My passion lies in the intersection of Robust and Explainable Artificial Intelligence, Robotics and Unsupervised Learning. My long-term research goal is to build robots for long-term deployments in homes and workplaces, that are able to learn, adapt and cooperate with humans to achieve any task.

In my free time I browse through Semantic Scholar research feeds and drink cocktails with friends.
