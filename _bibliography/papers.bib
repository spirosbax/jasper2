  abstract={Loss of voice, which may be due to problems in various organs of the human voice system is a major disability which most of the time results in social isolation. In most cases of complete voice loss, the problem cannot be improved over time and despite the fact that methods have been developed to recon- struct voice, none come close to the natural pitch of the person’s voice. The present work proposes a novel personalized system that integrates audiovisual information and autonomous learning in order to reconstruct a disabled person’s voice. The system makes use of a smartphone’s camera and microphone while the majority of computations will not be performed locally but in the cloud. Using computational methods for signal processing as well as machine learning algorithms we believe that, a voice similar to the user’s own voice can be reproduced. Finally the aforementioned technologies will be incorporated into a personalized multimedia interface and the system will be evaluated during a multi-phase period by patients with serious chronic voice problems.},

  abstract={Digital communities and social media are widely used and produce a huge amount of information every second. Text analysis has been widely used by researchers and machine learning (ML) engineers for automating the author profiling task. Author profiling can be used in marketing and business intelligence frameworks but also remains a strong factor in crime investigations gaining more insight regarding the suspect. In this paper we describe the process we used in obtaining a new Twitter corpus and propose an ML approach to determine the gender of Greek author’s tweets. The best result (0.7 accuracy) was obtained using SVMs and TF-IDF encoding.},

  abstract={In this paper we introduce a novel MCTS based approach that is derived from the laws of the thermodynamics. The algorithm, coined Fractal Monte Carlo (FMC), allows us to create an agent that takes intelligent actions in both continuous and discrete environments while providing control over every aspect of the agent’s behavior. Results show that FMC is several orders of magnitude more efficient than similar techniques, such as MCTS, in the Atari games tested.}
